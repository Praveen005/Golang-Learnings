/*
	In Go, each concurrently executing activity is called a goroutine.

	When a program starts, its only goroutine is the one that calls the main func tion, so we call it
	the main goroutine. New goroutines are created by the go statement. Syntactically, a go statement is an ordinary function or method call prefixed by the key word go. A go statement causes the function to be calle d in a newly created goroutine.

	f() // call f(); wait for it to return
	go f() // create a new goroutine that calls f(); don't wait
