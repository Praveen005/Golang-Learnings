There are two migration files, as you would have noticed with suffix .up and .down, why?
    It is a best practice while writting Database migration.
    The upscript is made to make the forward change to the schema
    The down script is run to revert the chnage made by the up script

    So, when we run "migrate up" command, the upscript files inside the db/migration folder will be run sequentially by the order of their prefix version

    whereas, when we run the "migrate down" command the down script file inside the db/migration folder will be run sequentially by the reverse order of their prefix version
